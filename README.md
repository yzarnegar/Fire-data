# Fire-data

Many wildfires have been damaging California at the past and present time. Experts suggest causes for the fires such as climate change, warmer temperatures, equipment failure and wind. Jennifer Balch, director of Earth Lab at the University of Colorado Boulder, said “humans cause 84 percent of wildfires, and lightning causes the rest”. Although warm, dry and windy condition are considered as main reasons of wildfires getting started and spread, human also are to blame for California’s wildfires.
As I became interested these risk factors better, I used fire history data for California (1932-2018) and California average wind speed (2010-2014) and population density data from five-year period (2010-2014).

I considered any potential relation of population density and wind speed with the acres damaged by fire and the frequency of the fires at CA counties. It was assumed that the wind speed and population density are not significantly different from the ones for wildfire incidence dates as I could not access exact values for those specific dates. In Plot_1, data is scattered for the wind speed and for both high and low wind speeds there is not noticeable pattern in terms of the acres affected by the fire for different CA counties. Perhaps using wind data for specific months of the year where fire hazard is higher, may result in more accurate result. Also for the population density, for both high and low and medium density values, wildfires happened but there could be some pattern in there. In Plot_2 these factors are being analyzed together considering the frequency of the fires. For counties with high population such as Los Angeles, without experiencing high speed winds, there are high acres of land being affected by the fire and they are more frequent. For the smaller counties with less population, the high wind speed seems to be related with the wildfire incidents.  It looks like that in more populated areas, human has a major role in wildfires getting started. Considering and huge acres affected by fire and all the damages, initiating educational and taring programs as some preventive actions seem to be very helpful in reducing the fire incidents. More in depth analysis with bigger data such as data from other states and considering other potential risk factors are needed to reveal more accurate and precise results.
